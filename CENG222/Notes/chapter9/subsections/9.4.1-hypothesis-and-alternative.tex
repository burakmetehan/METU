\subsection{Hypothesis and Alternative}
\label{subsec:hypothesis-alternative}

To begin, we need to state exactly what we are testing. These are hypothesis and alternative.

\begin{formula}{NOTATION}
  \begin{center}
    $\begin{aligned}
      &H_0 = \textnormal{hypothesis (the null hypothesis)}\\
      &H_A = \textnormal{alternative (the alternative hypothesis)}
    \end{aligned}$
  \end{center}
\end{formula}

$H_0$ and $H_A$ are simply two mutually exclusive statements. Each test results either in acceptance of $H_0$ or its rejection in favor of $H_A$.
\begin{definition}{}
  Alternative of the type $H_A$: $\mu \neq \mu_0$ covering regions on both sides of the hypothesis ($H_0$: $\mu = \mu_0$) is a \textbf{two-sided alternative}.\\
  Alternative $H_A$: $\mu < \mu_0$ covering the region to the left of $H_0$ is \textbf{one-sided, left-tail.}\\
  Alternative $H_A$: $\mu > \mu_0$ covering the region to the right of $H_0$ is \textbf{one-sided, right-tail.}
\end{definition}
