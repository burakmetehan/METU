\section{Storage Element: Latches}
\label{sec:stor-ele-latch}

A storage element in a digital circuit can maintain a binary state indefinitely (as long as power is delivered to the circuit), until directed by an input signal to switch states.

\textit{Storage elements that operate with signal levels (rather than signal transitions) are referred to as latches; those controlled by a clock transition are flip-flops}.

Latches are said to be \textit{level-sensitive devices}; flip-flops are \textit{edge-sensitive devices}. The two types of storage elements are related because \textit{latches are the basic circuits from which all flip-flops are constructed}. Although latches are useful for storing binary information and for the design of asynchronous sequential circuits, they are not practical for use as storage elements in synchronous sequential circuits.
