\textbf{Abstraction:} Make a program or design reusable by enclosing it in a body, hiding the details, and defining a mechanism to access it. Main idea is separating the usage and implementation of program segments. It is vital in large scale programming. Abstraction is possible in any discipline involving design.

\paragraph*{Purpose}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Details are confusing
  \item Details may contain more error
  \item Repeating same details increase complexity and errors
  \item Abstraction philosophy: \textit{Declare once, use many times!}
  \item \textit{Code reusability} is the ultimate goal
  \item Parameterization improves power of abstraction
\end{itemize}
