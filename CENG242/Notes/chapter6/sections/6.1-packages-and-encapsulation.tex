\section{Program Units, Packages and Encapsulation}
\label{sec:packages-encapsulation}

A \textit{\textbf{program unit}} is any named part of a program that can be designed and implemented more-or-less independently. A well-designed program unit has a \textit{single purpose}, and has a \textit{simple application program interface}. If well designed, a program unit is likely to be modifiable (capable of being changed without forcing major changes to other program units), and is potentially reusable (capable of being used in many programs).

The \textit{\textbf{application program interface}} (or \textit{\textbf{API}}) of a program unit is the minimum information that application programmers need to know in order to use the program unit successfully.

For instance, a procedure's API consists of its \textit{identifier}, \textit{formal parameters}, and \textit{result type if any}, together with a \textit{specification of its observable behavior}. The procedure's API does \textit{not} include the algorithm used in its definition.

In large-scale program construction, complexity grows, and reusability and abstraction become important. For example,
\begin{table}[H]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{lp{.6\linewidth}}
    \rowcolor{blue!10} 50 lines & no abstraction is essential, all in main() \\
    \rowcolor{blue!5} 500 lines & function/procedure abstraction sufficient\\
    \rowcolor{blue!10} 5,000 lines & function groups forming modules, modules are combined to form the application\\
    \rowcolor{blue!5} 500,000 lines & heavy abstraction and modularization, all parts designed for reuse (libraries, components etc)
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Therefore, a programming language whose only program units are procedures (such as \texttt{C}) is suitable only for small-scale program construction. For large-scale program construction, the language should support large-scale program units such as \textit{packages}, \textit{abstract types}, and \textit{classes}.
