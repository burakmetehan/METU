\section{Parameter Estimation}
\label{sec:parameter-estimation}

We have learned a few elementary ways to determine the \textit{family of distributions}. Now, we learn how to \textit{estimate parameters of distributions}. As a result, a large family will be reduced to just one distribution that we can use for performance evaluation, forecasting, etc.

Statisticians developed a number of estimation techniques, each having certain optimal properties. Two rather popular methods are discussed in this section:
\begin{itemize}
  \item method of moments, and
  \item method of maximum likelihood.
\end{itemize}
