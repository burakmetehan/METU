\section{Summary and Conclusion}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Continuous distributions are used to model various times, sizes, measurements, and all other random variables that assume an entire interval of possible values.
    \item Continuous distributions are described by their densities that play a role analogous to probability mass functions of discrete variables. Computing probabilities essentially reduces to integrating a density over the given set. Expectations and variances are defined similarly to the discrete case, replacing a probability mass function by a density and summation by integration.
    \item In different situations, one uses Uniform, Exponential, Gamma, or Normal distributions.
    \item The Central Limit Theorem states that a standardized sum of a large number of independent random variables is approximately Normal, thus Table A4 can be used to compute related probabilities. A continuity correction should be used when a discrete distribution is approximated by a continuous distribution.
