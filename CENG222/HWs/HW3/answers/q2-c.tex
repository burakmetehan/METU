Only standard deviation is changed to 1.0 from 0.8. Other data is same with the part a.

The formula is,
\begin{equation*}
  Z = \frac{\bar{X} - \mu_0}{\sigma / \sqrt{n}}
\end{equation*}
When the given variables are inserted,
\begin{equation*}
  Z = \frac{7.4 - 7.5}{1.0 / \sqrt{256}} = -1.6
\end{equation*}
We know critical value from part a.
\begin{equation*}
  z_{\alpha} = 1.6449
\end{equation*}

So our acceptance region is $[-1.6449,\ \infty)$. Since $-1.6 > -1.6449$ ``$-1.6 \in [-1.6449,\ \infty)$'', sufficient evidence in favor of $H_0$ is provided (and sufficient evidence against $H_A$ is also provided.)\\

Thus, restaurant A \textbf{\textit{should}} be in my list of candidate restaurants to order food from.
