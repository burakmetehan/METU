\section{Unknown Standard Deviation}
\label{sec:unknown-standard-deviation}

A rather heavy condition was assumed when we constructed all the confidence intervals. We assumed a \textit{known standard deviation} $\sigma$ and used it in all the derived formulas.

Sometimes this assumption is perfectly valid and we may know the variance. However, generally, the population variance is \textit{unknown}. We'll then estimate it from data and see if we can still apply methods of the previous section.

Two broad situations will be considered:
\begin{itemize}
  \item large samples from any distribution,
  \item samples of any size from a Normal distribution.
\end{itemize}
