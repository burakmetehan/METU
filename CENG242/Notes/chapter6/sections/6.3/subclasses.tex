\subsection{Subclasses}
\label{subsec:subclasses}

Let $C$ denotes a class. A \textit{\textbf{subclass}} of $C$ is a set of objects that are similar to one another but richer than the objects of class $C$. An object of the subclass has all the variable components of an object of class $C$, but may have extra variable components. Likewise, an object of the subclass is equipped with all the methods of class $C$, but may be equipped with extra methods.

If $S$ is a subclass of $C$, we also say that $C$ is a \textit{\textbf{superclass}} of $S$.

A subclass is said to \textit{\textbf{inherit}} its superclass's variable components and methods. In certain circumstances, however, a subclass may \textit{\textbf{override}} some of its superclass's methods, by providing more specialized versions of these methods.

A \textit{private} component is visible only in its own class, while a \textit{public} component is visible everywhere. A \textit{\textbf{protected}} component is \textit{visible not only in its own class but also in any subclasses}. Protected status is therefore intermediate between private status and public status.
